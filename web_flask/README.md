Project for Holberton School. This is the web framework part of the AirBnB clone project, built with Flask.

## Description

This project is part of the AirBnB clone series. In this specific project, we are implementing a web framework using Flask, which will allow us to display data from our AirBnB clone in a web-based format.

The main objectives of this project are:

- Develop a Flask web application.
- Implement different routes for displaying information.
- Integrate data from our AirBnB clone into the web application.

## Concepts

In this project, you will get familiar with the following concepts:

- Web Frameworks
- Routing in Flask
- Templating with Jinja
- Handling data from a database
